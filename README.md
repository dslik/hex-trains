## Hextile Train System

Small PCB-based hex tiles that snap together using magnets to allow you to build various simulated rail networks:

- Train position on track, track conditions, moving block, signals, etc, shown using small RGB LEDs.
- Run virtual consists across physically reconfigurable networks to deliver goods or passengers.
- Configure schedules and signalling
- Customize tiles with stickers for different landscape, station and industries.

Can also be used to create multi-player games.
